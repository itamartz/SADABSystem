## üéØ Recommended Development Priorities

### **Priority 1: Complete Core Pages** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

These pages provide the essential functionality users need to manage their infrastructure.

#### 1. Deployments Page (HIGHEST VALUE)
**Why First:** Core value proposition of SADAB - users need to create and monitor software deployments.

**Features to Implement:**

**List View:**
- Display all deployments in a data grid/table
- Columns: Name, Type, Status, Target Count, Success/Failed, Created At, Actions
- Filtering by status (All, Pending, Running, Completed, Failed)
- Sorting by date, name, status
- Pagination (10/25/50 per page)
- Search by name
- Status badges with colors
- Progress indicators for running deployments

**Create Deployment Form/Wizard:**
- Step 1: Basic Info
  - Deployment name (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Deployment type dropdown (Executable, PowerShell, Batch, FileCopy)
- Step 2: Package Selection
  - List available packages from Deployments folder
  - Upload new package option (drag & drop)
  - Show package details (size, files)
- Step 3: Execution Configuration
  - Executable path (for Executable type)
  - Arguments (text input)
  - Run as admin checkbox
  - Timeout (minutes) with validation
  - Success exit codes (comma-separated list, default: 0)
- Step 4: Target Selection

  - Retry button for failed agents
- Action Buttons:
  - Start (if pending)
  - Stop (if running)
  - Retry Failed
  - Delete
  - Clone (create new with same settings)

**API Endpoints Needed (Already Exist in Backend):**
- GET /api/deployments - Get all deployments ‚úÖ
- GET /api/deployments/{id} - Get deployment details ‚úÖ
- POST /api/deployments - Create deployment ‚úÖ

## üìã Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Currently: Component-level state
- Consider: Shared state service for cross-page data
- For real-time: SignalR hub or polling service

### Authentication
- Backend has JWT authentication
- Need to implement:
  - Login page
  - Token storage (localStorage or cookie)
  - HTTP interceptor to add bearer token
  - Redirect to login if 401
  - Logout functionality

### File Upload (For Deployments)
- Need component for package upload
- Consider: Drag & drop, progress bar
- Size validation, file type validation
- Store in server's Deployments folder

### Real-Time Updates
- Option A: **Polling** (simple, works everywhere)
  - Pros: Easy to implement, no server changes
  - Cons: Higher bandwidth, slight delay
- Option B: **SignalR** (better UX)
  - Pros: Real-time, efficient
  - Cons: Requires server hub setup

### Code Reusability
Create shared components:
- `StatusBadge.razor` - Reusable status indicator
- `ConfirmDialog.razor` - Confirmation modal
- `LoadingSpinner.razor` - Loading indicator
- `DataTable.razor` - Generic data table with sorting/filtering
- `EmptyState.razor` - Consistent empty state UI
- `Toast.razor` - Notification system

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services (mock HttpClient)
- Integration tests for components (bUnit)
- E2E tests for critical flows (Playwright/Selenium)
- Manual testing checklist for each page

---

## üí≠ My Recommendation

**Start with the Deployments Page** because:

1. **Highest Business Value** - It's why users need SADAB
2. **Most Complex** - Get the hard part done first
3. **Demonstrates Full Stack** - Touches all layers
4. **User Feedback** - Can validate the approach early
5. **Momentum** - Big feature completion is motivating

**Alternative: Start with Agents Page** if:
- You want quick wins (simpler to implement)
- Users are asking for agent management first
- You want to establish patterns before tackling complex forms

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tips

### For Deployments Page:
1. Start with list view (reuse Dashboard pattern)
2. Add detail view (similar to what we'd build for agents)
3. Build create form incrementally (one step at a time)
4. Test each step before moving to the next
5. Add file upload last (most complex part)

### For All Pages:
1. **Copy Dashboard patterns** - Reuse what works
2. **Add documentation as you go** - Keep up the quality
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't build everything before testing
4. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits
5. **Mobile-first** - Consider responsive design from the start

### Avoid These Pitfalls:
- ‚ùå Building entire form before testing
- ‚ùå Skipping documentation (you'll forget later)
- ‚ùå Ignoring error states
- ‚ùå Not handling loading states
- ‚ùå Forgetting about mobile users

---

## üìù Decision Points

Before starting, decide on:

1. **Authentication Approach**
   - Use existing JWT from backend?
   - Need login UI?
   - Where to store tokens?

2. **Real-Time Strategy**
   - Polling or SignalR?
   - Update frequency?

3. **Component Library**
   - Use existing CSS or add component library?
   - Consider: Blazorise, MudBlazor, Radzen?
   - Or stick with custom CSS for consistency?

4. **File Upload**
   - Upload directly from browser?
   - Or reference existing files on server?

5. **Pagination Strategy**
   - Client-side or server-side?
   - How many items per page?

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

## ü§î Questions to Consider

Before implementing, think about:

1. **User Workflows**
   - How will users typically use the system?
   - What's the most common path?
   - Where do users need quick access?

2. **Security**
   - Who can delete agents/deployments?
   - Should there be approval workflows?
   - Audit logging requirements?

3. **Scalability**
   - How many agents do you expect?
   - How to handle 1000+ agents in UI?
   - Performance optimization needed?

4. **Deployment**
   - How will the web app be deployed?
   - Same server as API or separate?
   - SSL/HTTPS requirements?
