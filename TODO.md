# SADAB.Server/Controllers/
* All the SADAB.Server.Controllers should be under folder v1
* All the Controller should have [Route("api/v1[controller]")]
* Add supported to opentelemetry and send the data to local splunk core - HEC and Token will be in appsetting.json
* Add supported to Scalar
* All Controller should have a Return code explain like 200,201 etc.. will text explain for Swagger
* context.Database.EnsureCreated(); also E=add EnsureMigration()

* CommandExecutorService.cs just try to check if the ExitCode is 0 , but the Exit code Can be 3010 etc... The Exit code should be getting from the CommandExecutionDto as array of Exist code
* InventoryDTOs.cs - Should be add all Win32 also support the option to add a new Win32 Wmi Class

Based on where we are now, here are my recommendations for the next steps, prioritized by value:
ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps
Priority 1: Complete Core Pages (High Value)
1. Agents Page - Most critical for users
* Full agents list with pagination/filtering
* Agent detail view with:
   * System information
   * Certificate status
   * Deployment history
   * Command history
* Actions: Delete agent, execute command, view inventory
2. Deployments Page - Primary use case
* Create new deployment wizard/form:
   * Upload package files
   * Select target agents (checkbox list)
   * Configure execution parameters
   * Set success exit codes
* View all deployments with filtering
* Deployment detail page showing:
   * Per-agent results
   * Output logs
   * Progress tracking
* Actions: Start, stop, retry failed agents
3. Commands Page - Quick actions
* Execute command form:
   * Select target agents
   * Enter command/script
   * Set timeout and admin privileges
* Command history with filtering
* Command detail view with full output
* Re-execute command option
Priority 2: Dashboard Enhancements
* Make "Details" buttons navigate to agent detail pages
* Make "View Output" buttons show command details
* Add real-time updates (polling or SignalR)
* Add "See All" links to view full pages
Priority 3: Polish & UX
* Add loading spinners for better UX
* Add error notifications/toasts
* Implement confirmation dialogs (delete, etc.)
* Add search/filter components
* Responsive mobile design improvements
Priority 4: Advanced Features
* Inventory page (view collected system data)
* Certificates page (manage agent certificates)
* Activity Log (audit trail)
* Settings page (user preferences, API configuration)
* Authentication UI (if not using external auth)
ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation
Start with the Deployments Page because:
1. It's the core value proposition of SADAB
2. Users need to create and monitor deployments
3. It demonstrates the full workflow
4. The backend API is already complete
Then move to Agents Page and Commands Page to complete the essential management capabilities.
Which would you like to tackle first? I'd suggest starting with either:
* Deployments Page (most business value)
* Agents Page (most frequently used)
Or if you prefer, we could add interactivity to the existing Dashboard first (making buttons actually work).
