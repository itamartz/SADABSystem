@*
    App Component
    =============
    Root component for the Blazor application. This component only contains
    the routing logic. The HTML structure (<html>, <head>, <body>) is defined
    in _Host.cshtml for Blazor Server applications.

    The Routes component handles navigation and renders the appropriate page
    component based on the current URL.

<Routes />

@code {
    // No code needed - this is a simple wrapper around the Routes component
}
